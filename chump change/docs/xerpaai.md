# XerpaAI Documentation Pointers
- Public docs are limited; start at the main site: https://xerpa.ai/
- If hackathon provides sandbox/API keys, use those materials first.
- Check for product/API docs via partner portal or support channels.
- Suggested next step: request API reference and webhook/event formats from XerpaAI support to generate “Impact Report” tweets programmatically.
